## Quick start
Our project is a deep learning based image segmentation solution to first detect the brain tumor and predict the likelihood of tumor existence.
- To begin, clone the repo: 
``` 
git clone link_to_the_repo && cd folder_name 

``` 



## Prerequisites

Ensure you have met the following requirements by installing the following packages:

<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
  
* pandas==1.0.5
* numpy==1.18.5
* albumentations==0.5.2
* opencv_python_headless==4.4.0.46
* matplotlib==3.2.2
* torchvision==0.7.0
* torch==1.6.0
* scikit_learn==0.23.2

It can be done through this command line: ```pip install -r requirements```
## Dataset

The data can be found in this link: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation
">Brain MRI segmentation</a>. It can be loaded following these steps:

- Generate a key in you kaggle account.
- run these commands:

``` 
!mkdir ~/.kaggle/
!echo '{"username":"your_user_name","key":"key_you_have_generated"}' > ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
!kaggle datasets download -d mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation

```
## How to Train & Test
This <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation
">jupyter notebook</a> contains a simple tutorial on how to load the data, train and test the model.
Another alternative to train and test a model is to run the following script.
```
!python main.py
```
##### Please change $DATA_PATH variable at the veriy beginning of the notebook (if you are using it) to the path containing the MRI Brain Tumor detection data.
##### If you are running the script the $DATA_PATH variable can be located in the dataProcessing.py file.


Add run commands and examples you think users will find useful. Provide
an options reference for bonus points!
